## Abou This Project
This project is designed specifically to provide users with comprehensive information and resources about data-related job opportunities in Indonesia through dashboard visualization. The project's main objective is to assist job seekers, employers, and data enthusiasts in an efficient and user-friendly manner.

## Methodology
This project involved the implementation of an automated data collection pipeline using GitHub Actions. Using Python libraries like Pandas and BeautifulSoup, the pipeline performed web scraping on multiple websites on a weekly basis. The collected data was then stored in Google Sheets, serving as a convenient and structured database for efficient management and retrieval. To facilitate analysis and visualization, a dashboard was developed using Tableau Desktop, enabling users to explore and gain insights from the collected data.
